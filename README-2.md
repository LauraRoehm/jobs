# Sortlist Challenges - Senior Business intelligence Case

[Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com) is not just a beautiful interface, it’s a full experience with a deep integration from the user interface all the way to the servers we interact with. As Sortlist’s backbone, data are crucial to every aspect of our business, from product & dev prioritisation to business actions.

That’s why we’re looking for a talented Senior Business Intelligence specialist to join our highly motivated team and help us build in Sortlist inside out. As Mom used to say, beauty comes from within.

## The Lucanus Challenge 
or more commonly the **L**isten, **U**nderstand, **C**ohorts, **A**cknowledge, **N**arratives, **U**sers & **S**tories.

As Sortlist's new **Senior Business Intelligence Specialist** you'll need to get to know the business and behaviors of Sortlist's clients' behaviours. 

You have already studied & met all our team members after your training period at Sortlist and understand the Business model dynamic pretty well.

You know that **revenue recognized is driven by 3 main Sortlist's revenue streams** and you want to better understand our client's behaviors.

Recognized Revenue:	means the "revenue recognition" that is governed in the Company by the following principles, aligned to each specific stream:							
- subscription revenue: this refers to income from paid access to software features; revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription term; for instance, if a customer subscribes to the Company services for a 12 months term at a total EUR 1,200, the Company recognizes a EUR 100 (1/12th of the total amount) as revenue each month, irrespective of the actual usage; it must be a subscription that has been invoiced for the month in question, as opposed to a signed or trial period.
- credit pack revenue: this involves income from credits sold upfront for future consumption at discounted prices; this revenue is recognized as credits are consumed at a discounted rate; for example, if a customer buys a credit pack worth EUR 40k (providing a nominal value of EUR 57k due to a 30% discount) and consumes services worth EUR 1k (nominal value) in a given month, the Company recognizes EUR 0.7k (70% of EUR 1k reflecting the discounted rate) as revenue; additionally, any credits not consumed within 12 months from purchase are treated as fully utilized and recognized as revenue on the expiration date;							
- pay-as-you-go revenue: this pertains to income from services that are not prepaid with credits; the revenue is recognized when the services are provided; for instance, if a customer with no prepaid credits consumes services worth EUR 500 in a month, the Company recognizes the full EUR 500 as revenue at month-end;							
Credits, set by default at €0 in the Company’s database and offered for commercial use, do not affect the Recognised Revenue. However, credit notes used for reimbursing invoices can impact the recognized revenue retroactively. For instance, if a customer consumes paid credits in May, which were invoiced and paid for in April, and for any reason those paid credits must be reimbursed in June, the Recognised Revenue of May will be retroactively decreased by the amount of the credit note.

Other info:
We define our Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) as a customer having at least 25 employees and having its headquarters in following the countries: United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany and France. All other customers would be referenced as 'Non-ICP'.

You want to make sure to give important insights to the management team by helping them *understand the company's growth and the leverages that Sortlist has at an international level*.

Therefore, you have received a small set of Data in the following Spreadsheet  
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10AurCWbM5uuB8fUYlGfUm7Adqaq6rg2q2rOX9gc6iRE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The Spreadsheet </a>

Your goal is to understand the Service Providers' behavior (accounts) on Sortlist in time, per country, and per ICP type.

## Time for the test: 
We have estimated that a **senior Business Intelligence specialist** with great Marketplace, SAAS, and/or Tableau knowledge should be able to do the work in less than 3 hours. 

The test is not timed, the time you will need to do the entire test will depend on your knowledge base, research & learning skills ;).

Good luck!


## Hints & tips: 
1. Duplicate the Google spreadsheet
2. Discrepency in Data is possible
4. Note that amounts purchase and/or refund are **not linked to plan type period** 
e.g: 
  * yearly plan could be sold at 250 EUR/year => 20.83333 EUR/Month
  * monthly plan could be sold at 250 EUR/month => 3000 EUR/YEAR 

## Exercices: 

1. Revenue Analysis: 
a. Which Customer has the biggest consumption level & how many months has it been active?
b. Which country is generating the most revenue? 
c. Calculate the Recognized Revenue for each customer based on the revenue recognition principles provided. 
d. Segment the revenue based on the three streams: Subscription, Credit Pack, and Pay-as-you-go.

2. Visualization: Create interactive dashboards in Tableau that: 
a. Show monthly recognized revenue segmented by the three streams. Is there any difference between ICP and Non-ICP customers?
c. Illustrate the correlation between employee team size and consumption of units.

3. Cohort Analysis:
The management seeks to understand if our customer base is improving over time. For that, they would like to compare customers starting at different periods and analyze their behavior. What do you propose?

4. Insights and Observations: 
Document your findings, specifically any patterns or interesting observations about the correlation between employee size and unit consumption.

## Extra Bonus

1. How is the revenue churn evolving in time? Can you explain why it is good and/or bad for Sortlist? 

2. How would you display on Tableau a clear visualisation of the revenue churn per countries?


### Technical Specifications

You are asked to create a project on https://www.tableau.com/ public that can be used with dynamic filters.
The project will gather dashboards & workbooks that could be shared with our team.
