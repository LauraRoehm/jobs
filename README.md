# Sortlist Challenges - Back-end

[Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com) is not just a beautiful interface, it’s a full experience with a deep integration from the user interface all the way to the servers we interact with. As Sortlist’s backbone, the development is crucial to every aspect of our web application and client apps rely heavily on it. That’s why we’re looking for a talented for back-end Engineer to join our highly motivated development team and help us build Sortlist inside out. As Mom used to say, beauty comes from within. There is much more that we want to build and so much that we could improve. We value strong engineers who are agile enough to jump into most projects.

## The Yoda Agency challenge

You are asked to write a web application that dynamically shows a list of agencies. Each agency has multiple properties: `agency.name`, `agency.description`, `agency.tags` and `agency.grade`. The grade of an agency will be `padawan`, `jedi` or `master`.

The list should be filterable by the properties `name`, `tags` and ordered by their grades. You should alse be able to create an agency in the application.

### Technical Specifications

We strongly recommend to use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) or [NodeJS (Express)](https://nodejs.org/) to construct your app. We also ask you to use a relational database (e.g. [postgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)).

For the front-end, please use html views. 

Some Libraries to consider for the front-end:
 * [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) or [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)

#### Testing

Write tests for critical parts of your app. The process of writing tests for your code also reminds you of input cases that you may have missed before.
