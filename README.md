# Sortlist Challenges - Front-End

Frontend Engineers are an essential part of [Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com)’s Product Team. Working closely with designers, we implement the user interface of our web app. We build libraries and abstractions to make our lives easier. We make the most of modern tools like AngularJS, ES6, and SASS, and we ensure our UIs work well on all screen sizes. Some of us specialize in CSS, some in frontend infrastructure, but all of us are JavaScript pros and full-stack engineers.

## The Yoda Agency challenge

You are asked to write a front-end web application that dynamically shows a list of agencies. Each agency has multiple properties: `agency.name`, `agency.description`, `agency.tags` and `agency.grade`. The grade of an agency will be `padawan`, `jedi` or `master`.

The list should be filterable by the properties `name`, `tags` and ordered by their grades. You should alse be able to create an agency in the application.

### Technical Specifications

#### Front-End
We ask you to use the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework. Don't hesitate to use ECMAScript 6 specifications.

Some Libraries to consider:
 * [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) or [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 * [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

#### Back-End

As it is a front-end challenge, no back-end application is asked.

#### Instructions

Give your instructions to deploy the front application.


Create a new private GitHub repository. Immediately after the project initialization (auto-generated stuff), **please switch on another branch** and push your commits to it as you are completing the challenge. It would help us to review your code through a pull request.

In order to see how you work, we are interested in seeing each commit. A big dump of your project to github in one commit is not a good idea.

Once you are ready, add the dev team (@charlesdg, @gagalago, @matthieusieben) from the Sortlist team to the repository and send an email for us (charles@sortlist.com, simon@sortlist.com, matthieu@sortlist.com) to review it.

Don't hesitate to ask us questions. Displaying creativity is a bonus in all challenges.

#### Testing

Write tests for critical parts of your app. The process of writing tests for your code also reminds you of input cases that you may have missed before.

#### Side notes

Keep in mind what we will compare your work with our own production application. While we are not asking for a full production-ready app, we’d like to see that your code has that potential:

 * clean
 * flexible
 * extensible
 * maintainable
 * great error/exception handling & reporting
