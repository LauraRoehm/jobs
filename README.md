# Sortlist Challenges

[Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com) is not just a beautiful interface, it’s a full experience with a deep integration from the user interface all the way to the servers we interact with. As Sortlist’s backbone, the development is crucial to every aspect of our web application and client apps rely heavily on it.

That’s why we’re looking for a talented Full-Stack Engineer to join our highly motivated development team and help us build Sortlist inside out. As Mom used to say, beauty comes from within.

## The Yoda Agency challenge

You are asked to write a web application that dynamically shows a list of agencies. Each agency has multiple properties: `agency.name`, `agency.description`, `agency.tags` and `agency.grade`. The grade of an agency will be `padawan`, `jedi` or `master`.

The list should be filterable by the properties `name`, `tags` and ordered by their grades. You should alse be able to create an agency in the application.

### Technical Specifications

#### Front-End
We ask you to use the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework to build the front-end part of the challenge. Don't hesitate to use ECMAScript 6 specifications.

Some Libraries to consider:
 * [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 * [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

#### Back-End

We strongly recommend to use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) or [NodeJS (Express)](https://nodejs.org/). We also ask you to use a relational database (e.g. [postgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)).

#### Instructions

Give your instructions to deploy front & back-end applications.


Create a new private GitHub repository. Immediately after the project initialization (auto-generated stuff), **please switch on another branch** and push your commits to it as you are completing the challenge. It would help us to review your code through a pull request.

In order to see how you work, we are interested in seeing each commit. A big dump of your project to github in one commit is not a good idea.

Once you are ready, add the dev team (@charlesdg, @gagalago) from the Sortlist team to the repository and send an email for us (charles@sortlist.com, simon@sortlist.com) to review it.

Don't hesitate to ask us questions. Displaying creativity is a bonus in all challenges.

#### Testing

Write tests for critical parts of your app. The process of writing tests for your code also reminds you of input cases that you may have missed before.

#### Side notes

Keep in mind what we will compare your work with our own production application. While we are not asking for a full production-ready app, we’d like to see that your code has that potential:

 * clean
 * flexible
 * extensible
 * maintainable
 * great error/exception handling & reporting
