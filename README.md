# Sortlist Challenges - Data Analyst

[Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com) is not just a beautiful interface, it’s a full experience with a deep integration from the user interface all the way to the servers we interact with. As Sortlist’s backbone, the data is crucial to every aspect of our web application and client apps rely heavily on it. 

Understanding our users behaviour in the product, on the demand-side, supply-side and in the interaction of our marketplace is the key for Sortlist success. 

Data at Sortlist is used for all our product & development decision but as well business wise. 

That’s why we’re looking for a talented Senior Data Analyst to join our highly motivated team and help us build Sortlist inside out. As Mom used to say, beauty comes from within.

## The LUCANUS challenge (Listen, Understand, Cohorts, Aknowledge, Narratives, Users, Solutions).

You are asked to create a project on Tableau including one Dashboard that dynamically can filter the visualization by countries, and type of revenue our Subscribers that took a plan on Sortlist. 

-------

Each agency has multiple properties: `agency.name`, `agency.description`, `agency.tags` and `agency.grade`. The grade of an agency will be `padawan`, `jedi` or `master`.

The list should be filterable by the properties `name`, `tags` and ordered by their grades. You should alse be able to create an agency in the application.
