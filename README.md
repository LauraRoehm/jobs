# Sortlist Challenges - Front-End

Frontend Engineers are an essential part of [Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com)â€™s Product Team. Working closely with designers, we implement the user interface of our web app. We build libraries and abstractions to make our lives easier. We make the most of modern tools like AngularJS, ES6, and SASS, and we ensure our UIs work well on all screen sizes. Some of us specialize in CSS, some in frontend infrastructure, but all of us are JavaScript pros and full-stack engineers.

## The Yoda Agency challenge

You are asked to write a front-end web application that dynamically shows a list of agencies. Each agency has multiple properties: `agency.name`, `agency.description`, `agency.tags` and `agency.grade`. The grade of an agency will be `padawan`, `jedi` or `master`.

The list should be filterable by the properties `name`, `tags` and ordered by their grades. You should alse be able to create an agency in the application.

### Technical Specifications

#### Front-End
We ask you to use the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework. Don't hesitate to use ECMAScript 6 specifications.

Some Libraries to consider:
 * [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) or [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 * [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

#### Back-End

As it is a front-end challenge, no back-end application is asked.

#### Testing

Write tests for critical parts of your app. The process of writing tests for your code also reminds you of input cases that you may have missed before.
