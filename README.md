# Sortlist Challenges

[Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com) is not just a beautiful interface, it’s a full experience with a deep integration from the user interface all the way to the servers we interact with. As Sortlist’s backbone, the development is crucial to every aspect of our web application and client apps rely heavily on it.

That’s why we’re looking for a talented Engineer to join our highly motivated development team and help us build Sortlist inside out. As Mom used to say, beauty comes from within.

You can see here 3 differents challenges:
- [Full-Stack](https://github.com/sortlist/jobs/blob/full-stack)
- [Front-end](https://github.com/sortlist/jobs/blob/front-end)
- [Back-end](https://github.com/sortlist/jobs/blob/back-end)

Pick up which best fit you and go ahead!

#### Instructions

Give your instructions to deploy your application.

Create a new private GitHub repository. Immediately after the project initialization (auto-generated stuff), **please switch on another branch** and push your commits to it as you are completing the challenge. It would help us to review your code through a pull request.

In order to see how you work, we are interested in seeing each commit. A big dump of your project to github in one commit is not a good idea.

Once you are ready, add the dev team (@charlesdg, @gagalago, @matthieusieben) from the Sortlist team to the repository and send an email for us (charles@sortlist.com, simon@sortlist.com, matthieu@sortlist.com) to review it.

Don't hesitate to ask us questions. Displaying creativity is a bonus in all challenges.


#### Side notes

Keep in mind what we will compare your work with our own production application. While we are not asking for a full production-ready app, we’d like to see that your code has that potential:

 * clean
 * flexible
 * extensible
 * maintainable
 * great error/exception handling & reporting
