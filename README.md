# Sortlist Challenges - Integration

[Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com) is not just a beautiful interface, it’s a full experience with a deep integration from the user interface all the way to the servers we interact with. As Sortlist’s backbone, the development is crucial to every aspect of our web application and client apps rely heavily on it.

That’s why we’re looking for a talented Engineer to join our highly motivated development team and help us build Sortlist inside out. As Mom used to say, beauty comes from within.

#### Technical Specifications

For this challenge, you'll be asked to create a Sortlist branded page using the framework from AngularJS Material. As Sortlist apps have been built upon the same framework, it is crucial to understand the Angular Material System specifications and constraints. If you are not familiar with the Angular Material Framework, start by having a look at the doc here: [AngularJS Material Documentation](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/getting-started).

On this brand new page, you'll have to display a list of agencies in the form of cards. Each of these agencies would have multiple properties that you would have to assemble and display in a fashion way.

These properties are the following:
- agency.name
- agency.location
- agency.illustration
- agency.reviews
- agency.works
- agency.team
- agency.services
- agency.phone

This page should be structured as followed:
* A navbar including navigation items.
* A scrollable body including the agencies list.

To bootstrap your page, just follow the HTML structure from this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/team/AngularMaterial/pen/RrbXyW.)
