# Sortlist Challenges - Data Analyst

[Sortlist](https://www.sortlist.com) is not just a beautiful interface, it’s a full experience with a deep integration from the user interface all the way to the servers we interact with. As Sortlist’s backbone, data are crucial to every aspect of our business from product & dev prioritisation to business actions.

That’s why we’re looking for a talented Data Analyst to join our highly motivated team and help us build Sortlist inside out. As Mom used to say, beauty comes from within.

## The LUCANUS Challenge 
or more commonly the Listen, Understand, Cohorts, Aknowledge, Narratives, Users & Stories.

As the new **Data Analyst** of Sortlist you need to get to know the business and behaviors of Sortlist's clients. 

You have already studied & meet all our team members after your training period at Sortlist and understand the Business model dynamic pretty well.

You know that **subscriptions are the main Sortlist's revenue driver** and you want to better understand them.

You want to make sure to give important insights to the management team by helping them to *understand the company growth and the leverages that Sortlist has at international level*.

Therefore, you have received a small set of Data in the following Spreadsheet  
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DSHE0r-RVgzaNjc8wyvG7_gVVYUOCdm78fO3MajlK8s/edit#gid=0" target="_blank"> Spreadsheet </a>

Your goal is to understand the behaviors of agencies (accounts) on Sortlist in time, per countries, and per plan type.

## Hints & tips: 
1. Duplicate the Google spreadsheet
2. note that accounts can have multiple subscriptions
3. note that amounts purchase and/or refund are not linked to plan type period 
e.g: 
  * yearly plan could be sold at 250 EUR/year => 20.83333 EUR/Month
  * and a monthly plan could be sold at 250 EUR/month => 3000 EUR/YEAR 

## Exercices: 

1. Which Company has the most subscriptions & how many subscriptions it has?

2. Which country is generating the most revenue ? Can you create one dashboard on tableau displaying the evolution of revenue per week per country and per plan type ?

3. Which plan type is generating the most revenue ? 

5. Can you create one dashboard on tableau where we can visualize the MRR per plan type, country and agencies expertise ? 

6. How is the revenue churn evolving in time ? Can you explain why it is good and/or bad for Sortlist ? 

7. How would you display on tableau a clear visualization of the revenue churn per plan type & countries ?

The spreadsheet is composed of 4 tabs:
* Invoices : all the invoices since 2015-01-15
* Accounts : all the agencies accounts since 2015 
* Subscriptions : all the subscriptions 
* Plan_type : all the different plan period 

Once you have cover the 7 questions, please send them by email to thibaut@sortlist.com and olivier@sortlist.com with the link of your published workbook & the extract of your workbook.
